# Udemy Clone (Frontend Only)

This project is a **frontend clone of the Udemy platform**, built entirely using **HTML and CSS**. It is a static website that mimics the design and layout of Udemy’s homepage and course section. The purpose of this project is to practice frontend development fundamentals, focusing on clean UI design and responsive layouts without using JavaScript or any frameworks.

## 📌 Features

* **Homepage Layout** – Designed to look like Udemy’s landing page with structured sections.
* **Navigation Bar** – Includes logo, menu links, and a search bar for better user experience.
* **Course Cards** – Display of multiple courses in a card-based layout with titles, images, and short descriptions.
* **Categories Section** – Organized structure to showcase different course categories.
* **Responsive Design** – Adjusts layout for desktops, tablets, and mobile devices using CSS media queries.
* **Pure HTML & CSS** – No frameworks, libraries, or JavaScript used.

## 🎯 Learning Outcomes

By working on this project, I was able to:

* Strengthen my **HTML structure** and semantic element usage.
* Improve **CSS styling, positioning, and layout techniques**.
* Gain practical experience with **responsive web design** using media queries.
* Learn how to replicate **real-world website UIs** step by step.
* Build confidence in developing static websites from scratch.

## 🚀 Future Enhancements

In the future, I plan to add:

* JavaScript functionality (dropdowns, interactive search, dynamic course filtering).
* A backend system to manage courses dynamically.
* More pages such as login, signup, and course detail pages.

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

* **HTML5** – for structuring the content
* **CSS3** – for styling, layouts, and responsiveness
